# sensor-fault-detection
The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. The benefits of using an APS instead of a hydraulic system are the easy availability and long-term sustainability of natural air.
# Steps
1. Create setup.py file(We create it to make package)
2. Created sensor package for this project(
    creating a folder and inside that create __init__.py
)
3. Group of libraries called framework
4. Pipeline folder created along with that init file
5. components folder created along with that init file
6. Data Access folder created for fetching the data from database(Responsible to connect with database and create a csv file on which we can do our further work)
7. Cloud Storage folder created
8. Configuration folder created
9. constant folder created
10. Entity folder created
11. ml folder created
12. First let's connect with mongo db so we write codes in data access init file
13. Inside constant create database.py file 
14. Write the code for configuartion to connect to database the file name mongodb_connection.py
15. Writing own exceptions
16. Writing the own logging file
17. Define all constants in constant folder
