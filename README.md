# sensor-fault-detection
The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. The benefits of using an APS instead of a hydraulic system are the easy availability and long-term sustainability of natural air.
# Steps
1. Create setup.py file(We create it to make package)
2. Created sensor package for this project(
    creating a folder and inside that create __init__.py
)
3. Group of libraries called framework
